Project Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn for a Telco company using machine learning techniques.

Data
The dataset used for this project is sourced from kaggle. It contains information on Telco customers including demographics, services subscribed, and churn status.

Model Training
The different machine learning models are trained. Data preprocessing involves handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical features.

Evaluation
Model performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC score. Cross-validation with 5 folds is used to assess generalization.
